If you’ve answered yes to both of these questions, then these career opportunities at Edrolo could be what you’re looking for. About the roles Edrolo is fully vertically integrated. This means that in addition to building our own technology, run internal sales teams, and work with clients to ensure they get great outcomes through our customer success team, we also develop all of our content in-house.
