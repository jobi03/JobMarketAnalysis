3,RESEARCH FELLOW IN MACHINE LEARNING FOR ENGINE CONTROL,University of Melbourne,Parkville VIC,"$69,148 - $93,830 a year","The research fellow will join a team of academic staff and postgraduate students working on problems related to the control and calibration of diesel engines. The team maintains a longstanding partnership with Toyota Motor Company in this area. This position is available for 2 years and will be reviewed at the end of this period. The aim of the research is to explore and develop novel algorithms that are implementable in real-time to improve the fuel economy and emissions of diesel engines. Given the constraints present in the system, much of the work to date has focused on the development of model predictive control designs. One of the challenges in implementation of these controllers is the calibration to achieve the appropriate level of performance under different legislated limits and consumer demands for different markets. We intend to develop methods (based on a combination of machine learning and traditional optimisation methods) that can partially automate the calibration process for these advanced controller designs, leading ultimately to faster calibration of better performing engine controllers. The research fellow must have a background in engineering or applied mathematics, with demonstrated expertise in modelling and control of dynamical systems and numerical optimisation. Experience with at least one of model predictive control; engine modelling and control; machine learning; and implementation of controllers on real systems is essential – while some background in more than one of these areas is highly desirable. The research fellow will be located in the Department of Electrical and Electronic Engineering in the Melbourne School of Engineering and will be expected to be an active member of the Department, collaborating with other researchers and engineers internally and externally. In addition to preparing technical reports, research publications, and computer simulations, the research fellow may also have the opportunity to undertake teaching and student supervision is areas directly related to their research. The Melbourne School of Engineering is strongly committed to supporting diversity and flexibility in the workplace. Applications for part-time or other flexible working arrangements will be welcomed and will be fully considered subject to meeting the inherent requirements of the position. The University plan seeks to increase the diversity of the workforce and the representation of women in areas they have been traditionally under-represented. Consistent with this the School is seeking to increase the representation of women in the academic workforce across engineering disciplines. Under a Special Measure, under Section 12 (1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) the School is seeking to lift the representation of women from 20% in 2014 to at least 25% over the next 5 years, and strongly encourages applications from suitably qualified female candidates. 30+ days ago - save job - original job Apply Now Jobs at University of Melbourne in Parkville VIC",https://au.indeed.com/viewjob?jk=120370ad9fc36fe4&from=tp-serp&tk=1c3d2t7gs80kn94k

17,RESEARCH FELLOW IN ADVERSARIAL MACHINE LEARNING,University of Melbourne,Parkville VIC,"$69,148 - $93,830 a year","Postdoctoral research fellow open in the ""Adversarial Machine Learning for Cybersecurity"" project in the School of Computing and Information Systems at the University of Melbourne, Australia. The 1 year full-time position is funded by the Defence Science and Technology Group, with CSIRO/Data61. This project aims to deliver new algorithmic and theoretical results on the robustness of machine learning systems, particularly reinforcement learning, in adversarial environments. Today Machine Learning and Statistics are employed in many technologies where participants have an incentive to game the system, for example network management, autonomous vehicles, medical devices, credit risk in finance, and smart utility grids. However little is known about how well state-of-the-art inference techniques fare when data is manipulated by a malicious adversary. Less is known about how to make learners robust to manipulation. This is particularly true for reinforcement learning. Key outputs of this project include publications reporting new algorithmic and theoretical ideas in adversarial learning, and demonstrations of adversarial reinforcement learning in software-defined networking. The ideal candidate would be an enthusiastic researcher with strong skills in: machine learning algorithms (particularly but not limited to reinforcement learning and deep learning methods), optimisation & linear algebra, and programming. Experience with machine learning applied in security (e.g., intrusion detection) or game theory is a plus. You will be part of a cross-institutional team spanning Melbourne and Swinburne Universities, DSTG and CSIRO/Data61, who collaboratively work on all aspects of the project, from concepts, theoretical underpinning, and design, through implementation and experimentation, to publication of results, curation of data, and maintenance of generated software. You will work side by side with other researchers in machine learning, game theory and computer security. Being located in the School of Computing & Information Sciences within the Melbourne School of Engineering, you will be expected to be an active member of the School, collaborating with other researchers. You may undertake small amounts of teaching and research supervision directly related to your area of research, as required. The Melbourne School of Engineering is strongly committed to supporting diversity and flexibility in the workplace. Applications for part-time or other flexible working arrangements will be welcomed and will be fully considered subject to meeting the inherent requirements of the position. The University plan seeks to increase the diversity of the workforce and the representation of women in areas they have been traditionally under-represented. Consistent with this the School is seeking to increase the representation of women in the academic workforce across engineering disciplines. Under a Special Measure, under Section 12 (1) of the Equal Opportunity Act 2010 (Vic) the School is seeking to lift the representation of women from 20% in 2014 to at least 25% over the next 5 years, and strongly encourages applications from suitably qualified female candidates. 27 days ago - save job - original job Apply Now Other jobs you may like RESEARCH FELLOW (MINING GOVERNANCE) University of Melbourne - Parkville VIC 1 day ago RESEARCH FELLOW (GIS & EXTRACTIVE INDUSTRIES) University of Melbourne - Parkville VIC 1 day ago Research Fellow (Architecture History, Theory...

112,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

169,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

199,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

228,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

276,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

324,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

354,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

394,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

409,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

424,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

482,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

496,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

Range 1 classroom teachers are skilled teachers who operate under general direction within clear guidelines following established work practices and documented priorities and may have responsibility for the supervision and training of one or more student teachers. At range 1, teachers participate in the development of school policies and programs and assist in the implementation of school priorities. The focus of a range 1 classroom teacher is on classroom management, subject content and teaching practice.

Under guidance, new entrants to the teaching profession will plan and teach student groups in one or more subjects and are expected to participate in induction programs and other professional learning activities that are designed to ensure the integration of curriculum, assessment and pedagogy across the school.

524,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.

546,Cryptologic Systems,Royal Australian Navy,Australia,"$70,868 a year","About the Job Interested in entering the world of Signals Intelligence? What do Cryptologic Systems Sailors actually do? They work in the field of Signals Intelligence (SIGINT), and are responsible for the interception and exploitation of electromagnetic emissions for the benefit of the Command and the warfare team in warships and Australian Intelligence Organisations. They specialise in Technical Signals (Techsig) Analysis, which is the analysis of machine-generated communications. In other words, they use sophisticated state of the art search receivers and other specialised equipment to intercept, record, analyse and disseminate technical parameters and other intelligence of signal transmissions. TECHNICAL SIGNALS (TECHSIG) The Cryptologic Systems sailor is responsible for performing the detection, acquisition, identification and exploitation of machine-generated communications. Some of the duties that a Cryptologic Systems sailor may perform include: Manually tuning or programming radio receivers and manipulating automated systems to prosecute known or unknown frequencies within the radio frequency spectrum Searching, identifying, analysing and reporting on transmissions of interest Utilising state of the art high-tech equipment to record selected or unknown transmissions to enable in-depth analysis of these signals At sea conduct initial real-time (tactical), as well as post intercept in-depth analysis of communications utilising sophisticated equipment in conjunction with a maths and physics based analytical process Provide tactical indication of possible threats to warships or unit being supported, in addition to producing technical reports and summaries on transmissions of interest and Operate other specific systems as required to support Signals Intelligence (SIGINT) tasking and reporting requirements. All CTS sailors will receive training on: Communications theory, including radio wave propagation Operation of acquisition, recording, and processing equipment Analytical techniques including methodical problem solving methods Communications networks Formats, terminology, and theory of pattern analysis (traffic analysis) The fighting structure or the order of battle' of foreign military forces Procedures for processing and distributing intelligence data* and Methods for handling, distributing, and safeguarding intelligence information. CT sailors will receive formal training for keyboard skills, but learning touch typing skills prior to enlistment is highly recommended in order to get ahead of the game. Cryptologic Category Sailors are a key component of the Navy Warfare Community, and part of a highly trained and internationally respected maritime force. The ability of the Navy to conduct combat operations depends on a number of factors with the professional skills and dedication of CTS sailors an integral part of this capability. Whilst all CTS personnel have specialist skills, they are first and foremost sailors. As such, they are expected to take part in normal Navy activities when at sea and ashore. Some of these activities include: Responding to emergencies such as a fire or flood Cleaning communal areas of the ship, including your own living space Loading supplies such as food, water and equipment and Working outside of your normal working hours as required COMMONLY ASKED QUESTIONS What kind of people does the Navy want? For CTS sailors the selection process is designed to determine people who can quickly grasp technical concepts, and are willing to work in a demanding environment as a key member of a Warfare or Intelligence Team. Usually the people that perform well in this role have a sound background in mathematics and are comfortable with the fundamentals of physics. Do I have to get some sort of a security clearance? Yes. The day-to-day employment of CTS sailors is of a highly sensitive nature. If the details of their employment were to be compromised, then lives of Australian servicemen and women could be jeopardised. For this reason, candidates for selection as CTS sailors undergo a detailed security evaluation. The security clearance procedure is necessary to ensure only suitable persons are granted access to sensitive information. All CTS sailors must be suitable to hold a Top Secret Positive Vet (TSPV) security clearance. There can be no exceptions to this requirement. Where will I work? At sea you will be employed in a tactical environment and utilise your specialist skills to provide situational awareness to Commanding Officers and Warfare Teams, in the form of early warning information. This enables possible threats to be avoided or neutralised, and helps to assure a winning edge in combat. When serving ashore, you will be either remotely supporting tactical war fighters at sea or the ADF in direct support of Coalition operations. You may also be involved in Australia's strategic intelligence collection effort. Whilst ashore you can expect to spend time in Canberra (ACT) and Nowra (NSW), and you may also have the opportunity to work in Toowoomba (QLD), Melbourne (VIC) or other localities depending on Navy requirements. During these non-sea postings, you can expect to work in a joint Defence environment with members of the Army and Air Force, as well as civilian personnel. Are women employed as CTS Sailors? Certainly, female CTS Sailors are employed under identical conditions as their male colleagues and have even been offered the opportunity to serve on submarines if they wish. Do all CTS Sailors serve on ships at sea? Yes, all CTS Sailors are required to serve at sea and can be deployed on any platform from an Armidale Class Patrol Boat (ACPB) to the new Amphibious ship scheduled to enter service in the near future. You may also be required to deploy on submarines as part of a specialist team. Service on submarines and surface ships attracts payment of substantial allowances that are additional to your normal salary. These allowances are tiered depending on length of service at sea. By virtue of Navy's core role of fighting and winning at sea the obligation for sea service will continue throughout each stage of your career progression. This service is fundamental to your professional development as a CTS Sailor.
