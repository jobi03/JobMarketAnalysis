Role Within our Advisory Services practice, we offer analysts a multitude of opportunities to start their career path in becoming a subject matter expert. Both the learning experience and business environment are highly dynamic, therefore the analyst role and career path are dynamic and evolving.

Analysts will gain a thorough understanding of derivative products and markets by focusing on pre and post-trade activities as they move towards client advisory and direct client interface. Learning takes place alongside experienced team members in an apprenticeship-style format to: Structure and model derivative transactions. Prepare and review transaction documents to assist with transaction execution, legal and regulatory compliance. Assist with client and market research, as well as preparation of client deliverables. The Complex Advisory team serves primarily corporate clients, outside of our Real Estate and Financial Institutions sectors. Most of our work is project based, and is designed to provide clients with deliverables that quantify financial risk, assess current risk management programs, and/or develop appropriate hedge strategies and policies. Project scope ranges from several days to several months, with project needs varying accordingly. The complex advisory team is often required to navigate extensive amounts of data, understand the application of complex economic and accounting constraints, apply real-world best practices around hedging strategy, and deliver actionable recommendations and findings to our clients.

Integration with External Systems – Ensuring that connectivity is tested and error free. Setting Up Reports – Working with clients to ensure that report output meets their expectations. Training clients on using the system – This would take place either onsite or via web meeting. Qualifications Due to the variety of projects the team encounters, it’s important that the composition of the team includes a variety of skill sets and experience levels, with some of the key skills noted below: Quantitative skills: the ability to work with large amounts of data and understand causal relationships, attention to detail in both inputs and outputs, experience with statistical analysis and financial modeling Communication skills: the ability to communicate complex subject matter in a way that educates and prioritizes findings, flexing delivery style to accommodate different audiences, engaging with clients on new project proposals and ongoing delivery, effective communication through various formats (PowerPoint slides, email, verbal, spreadsheets, etc.) Collaboration skills: the ability to share information internally to grow the capabilities of the team and to seek out knowledge from others when needed, partnering with external clients throughout a project, delivering on internal requirements to support other teams as needed Project management skills: the ability to prioritize competing demands and align resources with project deliverables, communicating internal and external expectations throughout a project A combination of these skills will be utilized by every team member, but we expect individual roles to draw out individual strengths that complement the team.
